This repository contains the dataset used in the study:

“Analysis of the distraction impact on driving performance across driving styles: A driving simulator study in various speed conditions.”

📊 Dataset Overview
The dataset comprises performance metrics collected from a driving simulator under six distinct traffic conditions:

🚗 Conditions 1–4:

Maximum ABS longitudinal acceleration (ABS LA)

Maximum speed

Minimum space headway (SH)

Standard deviation of lane position (SDLP)

⚡ Condition 5:

Acceleration Reaction Time (ART)

🛑 Condition 6:

Time to Initial Braking Location (TIBL)

All data is anonymized and provided in CSV format.

🛠️ How to Use

Each file includes one row per participant with corresponding metrics for each condition.
You can analyze the data using tools such as Python (pandas), R, or Excel.

In variable names:

“B” indicates the Baseline experiment

“HF” indicates the Hands-Free conversation experiment

“T” indicates the Texting experiment

Conditions are labeled numerically from 1 to 6
